add a `.gitignore` file without installing gitignore: ` npx gitignore node`

To install `yarn global add gitignore`

to create package.json with  `npm init -y`

use yarn run server because we're in development; will need yarn start to deploy.

There is a pattern called Model View Controller (MVC) 

## Opinion Alert

An application normally has three layers

-UI (view) , we are doing this on the controller
-Business Logic (Controller)
-Data (Model)

On APIs is more like Model Route Controller
